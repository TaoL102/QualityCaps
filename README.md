Introduction:

This is an assignment for my web application development course, I was taught to use web form to do this assignment, however, considering Asp.net MVC is the latest framwork and after comunication with tutor, I was permitted to use Asp.net MVC framwork to finish it.

Basically, I followed the tutorials on https://www.asp.net/mvc which is very detailed and helpful.

•	Programming language: C#
•	Framework: Asp.net MVC 4.6.1 (Entity Framework Code First)
•	Database: Azure Database
